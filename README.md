# Task Tracker Application

## Overview
This is a simple frontend web application built as part of the Full-Stack Internship Assignment. It allows users to manage a daily to-do list by adding tasks and tracking their completion status.

## Features
* **Add Tasks:** Users can input tasks via a text box and add them to the list.
* **View Tasks:** All tasks are displayed in a clean, scrollable list.
* **Track Status:** Tasks display a status of either `(Pending)` or `(Completed)`.
* **Mark as Completed:** Users can click a button to mark a task as done, which updates the visual style and status indicator.
* **Responsive Design:** Handles long text entries gracefully without breaking the layout.

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Structure of the application.
* **CSS3:** Styling, including color-coded status indicators (Red for Pending, Green for Completed).
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** DOM manipulation for adding tasks and toggling completion status.

## How to Run
1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  Type a task and press "Enter" or click "Add Task" to test.
